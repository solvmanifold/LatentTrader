# Documentation

This directory contains thorough documentation for the LatentTrader project, focusing on the features computed for tickers and market data.

## Overview

- **Ticker Features:** Detailed descriptions of all features computed for individual tickers, including technical indicators, price/volume metrics, and more.
- **Market Features:** Comprehensive documentation on market-wide features, such as market breadth, sector performance, volatility, and sentiment indicators.
- **Data Validation:** Documentation of the validation framework ensuring data quality and consistency across all features.

## Structure

- `ticker_features.md`: Documentation for ticker-specific features.
- `market_features.md`: Documentation for market-wide features.
- `validation.md`: Documentation of the data validation framework.

## Project Status

The project has completed several major milestones:
- âœ… Data standardization and validation framework
- âœ… Market feature collection and processing
- âœ… Ticker feature computation and storage
- ðŸš§ Feature normalization improvements (in progress)
- ðŸš§ Dataset generation enhancements (next up)

For detailed implementation plans and progress tracking, see `idea.md` in the project root.

## Data Quality

All data in the project is subject to rigorous validation:
- File naming conventions
- Column naming standards
- Data type validation
- Required column checks
- Data quality metrics
- Feature consistency validation

See `validation.md` for detailed information about the validation framework.

Feel free to explore each file for detailed information on the features and their significance.
